    <h1>Pumpkin Cheesecake Bars</h1>
    <img src="../images/Pumpkin-bars.webp" alt="done PumpkinBars">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>They have the perfect balance of savory pumpkin and tangy cheesecake.</p>
    <p>All the creamy texture of a fancy bakery cheesecake without the springform pan, the water bath, or any complicated steps!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pumpkin: This recipe uses pumpkin puree—the only ingredient should be pumpkin. Avoid pumpkin pie filling for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Cream Cheese: Use a block of full-fat cream cheese, don’t use spreadable cream cheese as it won’t firm up as well. Light cream cheese can be used, but the bars will be slightly softer.</li>
        <li>Topping: If time is short, use whipped topping or a can of whipped cream. This decadent dessert can get dressed up with tasty toppings like caramel sauce, a crunchy sprinkle of toasted pecans, a pumpkin spice granola, or a streusel topping.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make crust: Combine the crust ingredients right in the pan to save a bowl if you’d like! Simply stir and press.</li>
        <li>Prep filling: Ensure the ingredients are room temperature (including the eggs) for the smoothest filling.</li>
        <li>Bake and cool: Spread the cheesecake filling over the crust and bake. Cool completely before cutting.</li>
    </ol>
